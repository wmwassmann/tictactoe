## Project Information

This is a first and second attempt at a tic-tac-toe game using Python. 

## Startup

- To start version 1, run 'python tictactoe.py' in the command console.
- NOTE - Version 1 is only partially complete, as it was designed as a test run to see if my newly budding Python skills were up to the task without any research.
- To start version 2, run 'python tictactoev2.py' in the command consol.
- This version is complete and has been stress tested for most edge case issues, but please, attempt to break it. I am always looking for ways to improve my code's stability. 


## Technologies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/@WilliamWassmann/tictactoe-1#tictactoev2.py)

## Future

Future goals include
    - Fully modulated and properly sorted files and functions. 
    - Display to the browser and deployment.
    - An AI that implements either an aggressive strategy that tries for a WIN, or a defensive strategy that attempts to ensure a TIE. Randomly chosen, or chosen by the player.
